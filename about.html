            <p>I’m Thomas Freeman, a student currently in high school. I’ve been into computers since my first few years in primary school, and my interest for programming developed from there. It started with block-based drag-and-drop programs like Scratch, until the start of high school, when I started to learn Java.</p>
            <p>Now, I’ve also learned the basics of Python, and have explored many different fields within the computer science umbrella – including Machine Learning (ML) and graphics rendering. You can click on <a href = 'projects.html'>this link</a> to see some of the things I’ve done so far.</p>
